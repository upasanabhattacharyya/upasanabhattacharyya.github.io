As I reflect on my journey into the world of research, I can't help but acknowledge the various challenges and moments of self-doubt that have become my constant companions. My voyage into research began in January of this year, and it has been far from smooth sailing. The initial problem statement I was excited to work on has taken an unexpected detour, and the experiments I thought would yield groundbreaking results have left me feeling somewhat underwhelmed.

Upon introspection, I've identified a few key missteps that might have contributed to my current sense of failure.Here's a candid exploration of my missteps:

- *Lack of Extensive Literature Review:* I'll admit I was eager to dive into the practical aspects of my research, neglecting the wealth of knowledge that already exists in my chosen field. I came to realize that research isn't just about creating something new; it's about building upon what others have already discovered.

- *Not Clarifying the Significance of the Problem:* It's not enough to have an interesting problem fefining the significance of the problem statement is crucial. It's about asking the "so what?" question.

- *Lack of Self-Evaluation:* I have come to realise that healty quantity of self-evaluation is really important, especially when you're venturing into uncharted territory. It's a chance to refine my concepts, gather feedback, and iteratively improve my approach.

- *Not Sharing my Ideas:* I also regret not actively reaching out to my colleagues and friends for their perspectives and insights. Sharing your research challenges with others can lead to fresh ideas and alternative viewpoints.

My current struggle and sense of uncertainty have led me to question my decision to leave a stable job for the tumultuous world of research. Is this what research is all about? A constant battle to identify meaningful problems and generate innovative solutions? There are days when I wake up without a clear sense of direction, and I wonder if I made the right choice. But then, there are moments of clarity and inspiration when I realize **why** I embarked on this journey in the first place. I think my why is purely a self-exploratory selfish reason to test by own abilites and enjoy.

As I navigate these uncharted waters, I've started to explore not only my "why" but also the "whys" of others. There is a list of articles which I read now and then when I feel lost wandering:
